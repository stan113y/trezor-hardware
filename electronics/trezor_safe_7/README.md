# Trezor Safe 7 - Electronics Hardware
This folder contains both schematic designs and PCB renders of all the in-house developed PCBs present in the TS7 product. 

The TS7's electronics are split into three following PCBs
- Main board
- UI FPC
- ANT FPC

The display and battery also contain PCBs but these were not designed by Trezor's hardware team and therefore are not discloseable.
